## üí∞ Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Smart API Usage
```python
# Implement caching to reduce API calls
from buffetbot.utils.cache import CacheManager

cache = CacheManager(ttl=3600)  # 1 hour cache
data = cache.get_or_fetch('AAPL', api_fetch_function)
```

**Savings**: 60-80% reduction in API costs

### 2. Database Optimization
```sql
-- Use database connection pooling
-- Optimize queries with indexes
-- Regular maintenance and cleanup
```

**Savings**: 30-50% reduction in database costs

### 3. Infrastructure Right-Sizing
```bash
# Monitor resource usage and scale appropriately
# Use auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes
# Choose regional databases close to users
```

**Savings**: 20-40% reduction in hosting costs

### 4. Development Efficiency
```bash
# Use local development (free)
# Staging environment for testing
# Production only for live users
```

**Savings**: 50-70% reduction during development
