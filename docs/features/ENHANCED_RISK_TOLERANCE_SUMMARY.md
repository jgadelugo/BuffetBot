# Enhanced Risk Tolerance Functionality for Options Advisor

## Overview

The Options Advisor now features sophisticated risk tolerance functionality that provides users with tailored options analysis based on their individual risk preferences. This enhancement significantly improves the quality and relevance of options recommendations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Risk Tolerance Levels

### 1. **Conservative**
- **Philosophy**: Higher probability of success, lower risk
- **Characteristics**:
  - Prefers ITM to ATM options (moneyness 0.85-1.05)
  - Filters out extremely high IV options
  - Requires longer time to expiry (minimum 120 days for long calls)
  - Favors lower volatility and more stable strategies
  - Returns fewer, higher-quality recommendations (max 5)

### 2. **Moderate**
- **Philosophy**: Balanced risk/reward approach
- **Characteristics**:
  - Prefers ATM to moderately OTM options (moneyness 0.95-1.15)
  - Standard filtering and parameters
  - Balanced approach to time horizon
  - Standard number of recommendations

### 3. **Aggressive**
- **Philosophy**: Higher leverage, higher potential returns
- **Characteristics**:
  - Prefers OTM options for higher leverage (moneyness 1.0-1.25)
  - Accepts shorter time to expiry (minimum 30 days)
  - Allows higher volatility options
  - Returns more recommendations for selection (up to 15)
  - Boosts scores for momentum and high beta stocks

## ðŸ“Š Strategy-Specific Risk Adjustments

### Long Calls
- **Conservative**: ITM/ATM focus, longer expiry, lower IV penalty
- **Moderate**: Standard ATM to moderate OTM selection
- **Aggressive**: OTM focus for leverage, momentum/beta boost

### Bull Call Spreads
- **Conservative**: Narrower spreads (10% of stock price), higher profit ratios (>1.5)
- **Moderate**: Moderate spreads (15% of stock price), standard profit ratios (>1.2)
- **Aggressive**: Wider spreads (20% of stock price), lower profit ratios acceptable (>1.0)

### Covered Calls
- **Conservative**: Further OTM (5-15% above current), lower assignment risk
- **Moderate**: Standard OTM (2-12% above current)
- **Aggressive**: Closer to ATM (0-8% above current), higher premiums

### Cash-Secured Puts
- **Conservative**: Further OTM (8-25% below current), lower assignment risk
- **Moderate**: Standard OTM (5-20% below current)
- **Aggressive**: Closer to current price (2-15% below), higher income focus

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Risk Filtering Pipeline
1. **Moneyness Filtering**: Options filtered by strike price relative to current stock price
2. **Volatility Filtering**: IV thresholds based on risk tolerance
3. **Time Filtering**: Minimum days to expiry adjusted by risk preference
4. **Yield Filtering**: Minimum premium yields based on income requirements

### Scoring Adjustments
- **Conservative**: Penalties for high IV, bonuses for longer time, stability focus
- **Moderate**: Base scoring without adjustments
- **Aggressive**: Bonuses for momentum, high beta, growth potential

### Parameter Adjustments
- **Conservative**: Increases min_days to at least 60, caps recommendations at 5
- **Moderate**: Uses standard parameters
- **Aggressive**: Doubles top_n (capped at 10), allows shorter time horizons

## ðŸ“ˆ Enhanced Metadata

Each recommendation now includes:
- `risk_tolerance_applied`: Which tolerance level was used
- `strategy_type`: The options strategy employed
- `time_horizon`: Expected holding period
- `analysis_date`: When the analysis was performed

## ðŸ§ª Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual strategy function testing with risk tolerance
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end strategy dispatcher validation
- **Risk Validation**: Ensures different tolerances produce appropriate results
- **Metadata Consistency**: Verifies proper metadata application across strategies

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Strategy routing with risk tolerance parameters
- âœ… Parameter adjustments (min_days, top_n)
- âœ… Risk-specific filtering effects
- âœ… Strategy-specific risk tolerance applications
- âœ… Metadata consistency across all strategies

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits for Users

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Examples

### Dashboard Integration
```python
# Users can now select risk tolerance in the UI:
risk_tolerance = st.selectbox(
    "âš¡ Risk Tolerance",
    options=["Conservative", "Moderate", "Aggressive"],
    index=1,
    help="Your risk tolerance affects strategy recommendations"
)

# This gets passed to the strategy analyzer:
recommendations = analyze_options_strategy(
    strategy_type="Long Calls",
    ticker="AAPL",
    min_days=90,
    top_n=5,
    risk_tolerance=risk_tolerance,
    time_horizon="Medium-term (3-6 months)"
)
```

### API Integration
```python
# Direct function calls now support risk tolerance:
conservative_calls = recommend_long_calls(
    "AAPL",
    min_days=180,
    top_n=5,
    risk_tolerance="Conservative"
)

aggressive_spreads = recommend_bull_call_spread(
    "TSLA",
    min_days=60,
    top_n=8,
    risk_tolerance="Aggressive"
)
```

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: AI-powered risk tolerance detection based on trading history
- **Portfolio Integration**: Risk tolerance adjustments based on overall portfolio risk
- **Market Condition Adaptation**: Risk adjustments based on market volatility
- **Custom Risk Profiles**: User-defined risk parameters beyond the three standard levels

## ðŸ“Š Performance Impact
