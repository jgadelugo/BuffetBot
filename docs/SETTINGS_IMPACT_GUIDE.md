# Options Analysis Settings Impact Guide

## Overview

The BuffetBot Options Analysis Dashboard provides extensive customization options that allow users to fine-tune their analysis based on their trading style, risk tolerance, and market outlook. This guide explains how each setting impacts the analysis results and scoring.

## ðŸ“Š Scoring Weights

### What They Are
Scoring weights determine how much influence each technical indicator has on the final option recommendation score. The five core indicators are:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Momentum indicator (0-100)
- **Beta**: Market correlation coefficient
- **Momentum**: Price trend strength
- **IV (Implied Volatility)**: Option pricing uncertainty
- **Forecast**: Analyst forecast confidence

### How They Impact Analysis

#### High RSI Weight (25-30%)
- **Effect**: Prioritizes options on stocks with strong momentum
- **Best For**: Momentum traders, short-term strategies
- **Results**: Higher-scoring options will be on stocks with RSI > 50

#### High Beta Weight (25-30%)
- **Effect**: Factors in market correlation heavily
- **Best For**: Market-timing strategies, sector plays
- **Results**: Preference for stocks that move with/against market trends

#### High Momentum Weight (25-30%)
- **Effect**: Emphasizes sustained price trends
- **Best For**: Trend-following strategies
- **Results**: Options on stocks with clear directional movement score higher

#### High IV Weight (25-35%)
- **Effect**: Considers option pricing and volatility levels
- **Best For**: Income strategies, volatility trades
- **Results**: Options with attractive IV levels (high for selling, low for buying) score higher

#### High Forecast Weight (25-30%)
- **Effect**: Relies heavily on analyst predictions
- **Best For**: Fundamental-based trading, long-term holds
- **Results**: Options on stocks with strong analyst backing score higher

4. **Monitor Performance**: Track how settings changes affect recommendation quality
5. **Document Successful Configurations**: Save effective custom settings combinations
6. **Regular Review**: Reassess settings based on market conditions and performance

## ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls
