PROMPT FOR NEW CHAT - IMPLEMENTING BETTER APPROACH:

I have a Python project called BuffetBot that's a stock analysis dashboard built with Streamlit. The project currently has import path issues that I've temporarily fixed by adding path setup code to multiple files, but I know this isn't following best practices.

## Current Project Structure:
```
BuffetBot/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── app.py                    # Main Streamlit app
│   ├── streamlit_app.py         # Wrapper for local development
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── settings.py
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── forecast_panel.py
│   └── utils/
│       └── data_processing.py
├── data/
│   ├── fetcher/
│   │   ├── fetcher.py
│   │   └── utils/
│   │       ├── standardization.py
│   │       ├── logger.py
│   │       └── errors.py
│   └── cleaner.py
├── utils/
│   ├── errors.py
│   ├── logger.py
│   └── (other utility files)
├── pyproject.toml               # Already exists with package config
├── setup.py                    # Exists but minimal
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py                     # Entry point for Streamlit Cloud
└── run_dashboard.sh            # Local development script
```

## Current Problem:
The project has namespace conflicts between `dashboard.utils` and the root `utils` package. Files deep in the structure (like `data/fetcher/utils/standardization.py`) can't import from the root `utils` package without path manipulation.

## Temporary Fix Applied:
I've added this code to multiple files:
```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.absolute()
if str(project_root) not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))
```

This works but violates DRY principles and isn't maintainable.

## What I Need:
Please help me implement a proper solution using Python packaging best practices. I want to:

1. **Eliminate all the repetitive path setup code**
2. **Use proper relative imports or package installation**
3. **Maintain compatibility with both local development (`./run_dashboard.sh`) and Streamlit Cloud deployment**
4. **Follow Python packaging best practices**

## Deployment Requirements:
- Local development: `./run_dashboard.sh` should work
- Streamlit Cloud: Should be able to deploy using `main.py` as entry point
- The app uses imports like:
  - `from utils.errors import DataError`
  - `from data.fetcher import fetch_stock_data`
  - `from dashboard.config.settings import configure_streamlit_page`

## Question:
What's the best way to restructure this project to eliminate the path setup code while maintaining all functionality? Should I use `pip install -e .` approach, restructure the imports, or something else?

Please provide a step-by-step implementation plan with the specific changes needed to files and import statements.

## Files Currently Modified with Path Setup Code:
- dashboard/app.py
- dashboard/streamlit_app.py
- dashboard/utils/data_processing.py
- dashboard/components/forecast_panel.py
- data/fetcher/fetcher.py
- data/fetcher/utils/standardization.py
- data/fetcher/utils/logger.py
- data/fetcher/utils/errors.py

All these files have the same repetitive path setup code that should be eliminated with a proper solution.
