![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)
![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

A modular Python toolkit for evaluating companies and stocks using value investing principles. This suite provides deep insights into growth, value, financial health, and risk—ideal for data engineers, analysts, or quants looking to automate fundamental analysis.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project is designed to support **value-based investment decisions** through data-driven insights. It includes multiple analysis modules that compute key indicators from financial data, allowing users to screen and assess companies based on Warren Buffet-style criteria.

Each analysis module is standalone and can be extended or integrated into pipelines and dashboards.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-engineer-toolkit.git
cd data-engineer-toolkit

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run a sample analysis
python analysis/health_analysis.py
```

---

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Ensure you're using Python 3.10 or later.

---

## 🧪 Usage Examples

```python
from analysis.growth_analysis import analyze_growth
from analysis.risk_analysis import assess_risk

ticker = "AAPL"
growth_score = analyze_growth(ticker)
risk_profile = assess_risk(ticker)

print("Growth Score:", growth_score)
print("Risk Profile:", risk_profile)
```

> You may need to customize the functions to point to your data source (e.g., financial API, CSVs, or SQL).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

- You may need API keys or CSV data files. Update the script logic where applicable.
- Placeholder sections exist where data sources or constants need to be configured.
<!-- TODO: Specify if any `.env` or config files are needed -->

---

## 🧭 API / CLI Reference

This project is currently designed as a **modular codebase**, not a REST API or CLI. Each file under `analysis/` can be used as a Python module:

- `growth_analysis.py`: Revenue, EPS growth evaluation
- `risk_analysis.py`: Volatility, debt, liquidity checks
- `value_analysis.py`: Undervaluation vs. intrinsic value
- `health_analysis.py`: Balance sheet and ratios

## 🎨 UI Components

The project includes several UI implementations for visualizing financial metrics:

### React Components

#### MetricTooltip
A reusable, accessible tooltip component for displaying metric information inline.

```jsx
import MetricTooltip from './ui/react/MetricTooltip';

// Basic usage
<MetricTooltip metricKey="pe_ratio" />

// Custom text with tooltip
<MetricTooltip metricKey="revenue_growth">
  Revenue Growth Rate
</MetricTooltip>
```

**Features:**
- Fully accessible (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive positioning
- Dark mode support
- Memoized for performance
- Category-aware styling

#### GlossaryComponent
A comprehensive glossary viewer with search and filtering capabilities.

### Other UI Implementations
- **Streamlit App** (`ui/streamlit/glossary_app.py`): Interactive Python web app
- **Standalone HTML** (`ui/web/glossary_web.html`): No-server-required web page
- **React Glossary** (`ui/react/GlossaryComponent.jsx`): Full glossary viewer

See `/docs/glossary/ui_implementations.md` for detailed UI documentation.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What data source is used?**  
A: You'll need to plug in your own data source. The functions are adaptable for APIs or local datasets.

**Q: Can I use this with a database or data lake?**  
A: Yes, with minor adjustments to data ingestion sections.
